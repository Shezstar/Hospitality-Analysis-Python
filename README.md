# Hospitality Domain Project - Occupancy & Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands is a renowned hotel chain that has been in the market for 20 years. Recently, the company has been facing challenges, including a decline in revenue. This project focuses on analyzing the occupancy rates and revenue realized for AtliQ Grands and other associated hotels within the AtliQ hotel chain. The dataset includes information on hotel bookings, occupancy rates, and revenue generated over different periods.

The aim of this analysis is to provide insights into the hotel chain's performance based on room categories, city-specific occupancy trends, and revenue realized across various hotel types. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to the revenue decline and offer recommendations for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Hotel Type**: Categories like Atliq Seasons, Atliq Grands, etc.
- **Room Category**: Includes Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential Suite (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4).
- **City**: Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad.
- **Booking Platform**: Atliq Grands website, MakeYourTrip, Tipster, and others.
- **Occupancy Percentage**: Calculated based on bookings.
- **Revenue Realized**: Total revenue, including cancellation charges.

## Business Queries Addressed

1. **Average Occupancy Rate per Room Category**: This analysis determines the average occupancy rate for different room categories (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4).
2. **Average Occupancy Rate per City**: This query explores occupancy rates across different cities.
3. **Occupancy Rates for Weekdays vs. Weekends**: We compare occupancy rates on weekdays and weekends to identify trends.
4. **Revenue Realized per City**: Revenue data is analyzed across cities, taking into account cancellation charges.
5. **Revenue Realized per Hotel Type**: Insights into how different hotel types contribute to overall revenue.

## Data Visualizations

**Matplotlib** was used to create several data visualizations to support the analysis:

- **Bar Charts**: Used to compare occupancy rates and revenue realized across different cities and hotel types.
- **Pie Charts**: Used to show the proportion of revenue generated by different hotel types and room categories.

Examples of visualizations:
1. A **bar chart** comparing average occupancy rates for different cities.
2. A **pie chart** showing the distribution of revenue realized across different hotel types.

## Key Findings

- **Occupancy Rates**:
  - RT4 (Presidential Suite) has the highest occupancy rate (~58%).
  - Weekends see a higher occupancy rate (71.33%) compared to weekdays (50.86%).
  - Delhi had the highest occupancy rate during June 2022, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.

- **Revenue Insights**:
  - The highest revenue realized was in Mumbai, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
  - Atliq Palace and Atliq Exotica generated the most revenue among hotel types.

## Recommendations

1. **Boost Weekday Bookings**: Since weekends are busy, try offering special weekday deals like "Stay 2 Nights, Get 1 Free" to attract more guests during the week, especially in cities like Delhi and Hyderabad.

2. **Promote Premium Rooms**: The Presidential Suites are a hit, so why not offer early-bird discounts or VIP deals to fill more of those rooms? For Premium and Elite rooms, run promos during quieter times to keep them occupied.

3. **Target City-Specific Deals**: Cities like Bangalore have lower occupancy, so consider launching local experience packages or teaming up with events to attract guests. For cities like Delhi, focus on keeping regular customers loyal with a rewards program.

4. **Adjust Room Prices**: Offer lower rates on Standard and Elite rooms during slow periods to fill them up, but keep higher prices for luxury rooms during peak times.

5. **Make the Most of Cancellations**: When guests cancel, offer them discounts or credits for future stays, and try to upsell them to higher-category rooms to boost your revenue.
   

7. **Personalized Offers for Returning Guests**: Use past data to send special offers to guests who have stayed in higher-category rooms before, encouraging them to book again with perks or upgrades.

8. **Seasonal Deals and Event Packages**: Introduce seasonal promotions or tie in local events to attract more guests during slower months, like offering special packages during winter or festivals.

## Conclusion
By focusing on targeted marketing strategies, optimizing pricing, and using data-driven insights to offer personalized experiences, AtliQ Grands can enhance its occupancy rates, optimize revenue, and improve customer loyalty, ultimately recovering from the revenue decline
